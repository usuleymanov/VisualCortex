Simulation of human visual cortex inspiried by the Vsauce's [The Stillwell Brain video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rA5qnZUXcqo). Retina, V1, V2, V4 and Inferior Temporal (IT) Cortex is implemented as shown in the documentary video. 
For visualizing the simulation, a simple UI has been developed.
